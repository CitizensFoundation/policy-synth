European Consumer Organisations
European Consumer Centre (ECC)
The European Consumer Centre provides a free information and advice service on consumer rights in the EU. It is part of an EU wide network of consumer centres and it can help you to solve consumer disputes arising in other Member States of the EU. It does this by trying to solve the dispute directly and, if this fails, by referring your case to an Alternative Dispute Resolution organisation in the other Member State. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the European Commission jointly finances the Centre.
