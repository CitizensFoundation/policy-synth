## Our Mission and Passion
**Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence for impactful decisions**

Policy Synth is on a mission to foster better decision-making in both public and corporate contexts. We integrate traditional forms of collective intelligence—such as stakeholder input, community knowledge, or employee feedback—with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Through advanced agent-based models, we help:
- **Governments** design effective policies and engage citizens
- **Companies** refine strategies, optimize workflows, and engage employees or customers  
In short, Policy Synth helps diverse stakeholders collaborate with AI to tackle complex challenges more effectively.

## How Policy Synth AI Agents Work

### About AI Agents
AI agents in Policy Synth range from simple rule-based bots to sophisticated Large Language Models. They process data, apply decision-making logic, and produce actionable outputs, whether for civic policy proposals or corporate strategic plans.

---

### Fast vs. Slow Thinking
Terms **System 1** (fast, intuitive) and **System 2** (slow, analytical) from Daniel Kahneman’s work offer a helpful lens to understand AI behavior. LLMs often excel at System 1 tasks (quick, automatic responses), while more rigorous System 2 tasks require deliberative reasoning. Policy Synth embraces a **multi-agent** approach to combine both thinking styles.

---

### Our Agent Approach
Rather than striving for a single AI agent to handle everything, Policy Synth orchestrates specialized agents to collectively emulate **System 2** (deeper thinking) functionalities. For instance:
- **Engineer Agents** for software development,
- **Insight Agents** for policy or strategic proposals,
- **Evaluation Agents** for pros/cons assessment and stakeholder alignment.

This modular approach provides a balanced, scalable way to incorporate AI into real-world decision-making.

## Example Agent Queue Configuration

Policy Synth’s framework allows you to define and manage AI agent queues tailored to your organization’s needs.

## First Large-Scale Test Run (June 2023): Democracy in Distress
Our initial large-scale test focused on public policy. The test run demonstrates how:
1. A **core problem** is defined (e.g., “Democracy in Distress”).
2. **AI Agents** break the problem into sub-problems and propose solutions.
3. **Human and AI collaboration** refines and ranks those solutions, aided by:
   - **Genetic algorithms** (mutations and crossovers)
   - **Human weighting** for final fitness ranking
   - **Controlled injection** of new ideas via curated web searches
- **[Open Results: Democracy in Distress](https://policy-synth.ai/projects/1/)**

This example demonstrates how Policy Synth automates the exploration of sub-problems, generates policy solutions, and synthesizes expert knowledge and public input—all powered by large language models and specialized AI agents.

**Policy Synth** empowers leaders—whether in government, nonprofits, or businesses—to blend the collective intelligence of people with the analytical horsepower of AI. By orchestrating specialized agents, we can navigate complex challenges more effectively, paving the way for informed, impactful decisions.
