- If the text start with a numbered index like 1. or 4. do not remove it in your cleanup.
- Do not add anything to the document.
- Remove all lists of references and replace with empty text, do not make up text to replace those.
- Remove all lists of urls with the exception of single urls that are inline in actual text that is not a list. Replace those list of urls with empty text do not make up something instead.
- If there are very short paragraphs bring those into longer paragraphs.
- Also, always, split long paragraphs into smaller paragraphs.
- Do not change anything just remove unwanted artifacts and reformat paragraphs in the cleanup.
